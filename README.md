Bus49 is a Flutter application to help students navigate the UNC Charlotte campus transport system. Originally UNC Charlotte used the RideSystems (NextRide) app. Recently they switched to PassioGO. After hearing a lot of complaints from the student body I decided to see if it was possible to make a better app albeit still using Passio's data.

<br>

The app is built using Google's Flutter so that it can be easily developed and deployed to mobile, web and desktop all with one codebase.
